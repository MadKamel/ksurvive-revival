# KSurvive Revived
This is a revisitation of KSurvive, an old project of mine that I discontinued. I am thinking that I could revisit it and try and rebuild it. This time, I will make it properly: from scratch.

This is a game that runs under the Minetest 5.x Engine. Engine not included.

Note: The sound mechanics are currently under development. There is only one sound in the game so far, and it's very annoying to listen to. You probably don't want to play this right now.
